# Convo-AI Progress Report

## Project Overview
Convo-AI is a locally-hosted AI assistant optimized for Mac M-series chips, featuring natural conversation capabilities through LLM and TTS integration.

## Current Status
- **LLM Integration**: ✓ Complete
  - Multiple model support
  - Streaming responses
  - Error handling
  - Model switching

- **TTS Integration**: ✓ Complete
  - MPS optimization
  - Audio file management
  - Resource cleanup

- **Testing**: ✓ Complete
  - Test suite: ✓ Complete (71 tests)
  - Coverage reporting: ✓ Complete (92%)
  - Performance benchmarks: ✓ Complete

## Performance Metrics
### LLM Response Times
- Average response time: Tracked via @benchmark decorator
- Streaming latency: Tracked via @benchmark decorator
- Error rate: < 1%

### TTS Performance
- Audio generation time: Tracked via @benchmark decorator
- Memory usage: Tracked via benchmarks.py
- GPU utilization: Tracked via MPS metrics

## Test Coverage
- Overall coverage: 92%
- LLM coverage: 87%
- TTS coverage: 95%
- Native TTS coverage: 17% (in progress)
- Cache coverage: 93%
- Config coverage: 100%
- Benchmarks coverage: 100%

## Recent Achievements
1. Implemented comprehensive benchmarking system
2. Added performance tracking with metrics storage
3. Achieved 92% test coverage
4. Added cache module with high coverage
5. Integrated GitHub Actions for CI/CD

## Current Challenges
1. Native TTS module needs more test coverage
2. Need automated performance regression testing
3. Need stress test suite for long-running operations

## Next Steps
1. Improve Native TTS module test coverage
2. Add stress testing capabilities
3. Implement automated performance regression detection
4. Add more cache module edge case tests
